How to use:

1. Put the `ReflectionDocumentationGenerator.cs` file in an <i>Assets/Editor</i> folder (create one if you dont have)
2. Generate docs by clicking <i>Tools/Generate</i> Reflection Documentation
3. This will generate a file named `methods.json` in a folder named <i>Documentation</i> (under Assets)
4. You can move the rest of the files (`index.html, style.css and script.js`) into the Documentation folder
5. Open `index.html` and view your own generated docs!
